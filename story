The Tortoise and the Hare. 
In the woods there lived a very slow tortoise and a very swift hare.

One bright morning, the Tortoise was plodding along at his usual pace.
Suddenly, bounding past him was the Hare!
The storyâ€™s moral is supposed to teach you about how hard work and a steady effort can overcome natural talent.
In the end, it is not the speedy hare that wins the race.
